# beta-reader
Writing is a form of communication, and communication is all about pushing certain buttons to get a message across. But how does a writer know if they're pushing the right buttons?

Typically, they test it with beta readers; friends and family members who read it for them. There are several problems with this approach:

1. They can't give constructive criticism because they're too close to the author, and too afraid to offend.
2. They can't approach it from the perspective of a potential reader, because they know too much about it going in.
3. They know too much about the plot, because authors usually have the same people read multiple drafts.

Honestly, this is probably just going to be a test project for me to play around with some new framework. It came up because I just spontaneously remembered [usertesting.com](usertesting.com), and I thought it might be useful for writers as well.
